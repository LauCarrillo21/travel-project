            <h3> Mérida, "the White City" </h3>
            <p> 
                Mérida is distinguished for being a city full of peace, calm and for its kind and hospitable people.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is the ideal place for those who want to spend a vacation in a relaxed atmosphere and with a warm climate. Mérida was founded on January 6, 1542, and built on the Mayan city of <em> Toh </em>, which can be seen in the surroundings of its Plaza Grande, since its history, influence and culture were reflected in its architecture. Walking through its streets in an atmosphere of history and fun is what our beautiful Mérida offers you.

                    <p> 
                        In the Yucatan Peninsula there are at least 10,000 cenotes, which are a pool of water or a natural pond that only exist in few places in the world.
                    </p>
                    <h5> Cenote X-batún </h5>
                    <p> It is located 49 km. from the city of Merida  </p>
                    <h5> The most interesting natural phenomenon of Yucatán </h5>
                    <p> 
                        It is an open type cenote, which is approximately 20 meters deep. It is suitable for swimming and cave diving.
